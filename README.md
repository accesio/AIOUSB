ACCES is refactoring our Linux support, seeking to modernize and streamline our drivers and samples, and extend our list of supported programming languages to include modern dynamic languages (like Python, R, Java, etc).

The new Linux driver package for USB devicesis located at https://github.com/accesio/linux-drivers.

This project also incorporates PCI and PCI Express drivers, as well as PCI Express Mini Card and all related members of the extended PCI bus family, and drivers for ACCES Serial devices.
