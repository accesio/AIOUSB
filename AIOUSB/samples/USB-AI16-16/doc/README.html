<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This directory contains several sample programs for the USB-AI16-16A which demonstrate use of different
features and libraries.</p>

<h2>Basic AIOUSB Sample</h2>
<p><a href="sample2.c.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">Sample2.c</span></a> and
<a href="sample.cpp.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">sample.cpp</span></a> are simple
programs to demonstrate using the AIOUSB module to control an ACCES I/O model USB-AI16-16A analog input
board. These programs are nearly identical, one written for the standard gcc compiler and the other
written for the g++ compiler. They are not intended to be comprehensive demonstrations and are limited to
demonstrating the following features of the AIOUSB API:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Initializing and shutting down the API – <span class="funcname">AIOUSB_Init()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">AIOUSB_Exit()</span></p>
	<li><p>Identifying devices on the USB bus – <span class="funcname">QueryDeviceInfo()</span></p>
	<li><p>Obtaining the serial number of a device on the bus – <span class="funcname">GetDeviceSerialNumber()</span></p>
	<li><p>Configuring the board – <span class="funcname">ADC_SetConfig()</span></p>
	<li><p>Calibrating the converter – <span class="funcname">ADC_SetCal()</span></p>
	<li><p>Reading the analog inputs – <span class="funcname">ADC_GetScan()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">ADC_GetScanV()</span>, <span class="funcname">ADC_GetChannelV()</span></p>
	<li><p>Bulk reading of analog inputs – <span class="funcname">ADC_BulkAcquire()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">ADC_BulkPoll()</span>, <span class="funcname">AIOUSB_SetStreamingBlockSize()</span></p>
</ul>
<p>For easy identification, the source code lines prefixed with the comment <span class="computer bold">/*API*/</span>
denote calls to the AIOUSB API.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>Before building the program, make sure the <a href="http://www.libusb.org/" target="_blank">libusb</a>
module is installed. Also refer to the comments at the top of <span class="filename">sample.cpp</span> for additional details.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that the ACCES I/O AIOUSB module is installed (<span class="italic">see
<a href="../../../doc/README.html">Installing And Using AIOUSB Library</a></span>).</p>
<p>The simplest way to build the sample program is to type <span class="computer bold italic">make</span> at the command line.
The sample program is the default target in <span class="filename">Makefile</span>. Optionally, one can manually compile the
program with the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">g++ sample.cpp -laiousb -lusb-1.0 -o sample</p>
<h3>Executing</h3>
<p>Before executing the sample program, make sure the Linux system is configured to automatically
detect ACCES I/O devices plugged into the USB bus and upload the appropriate firmware to those devices.
The files that support this automatic configuration have recently been updated and new documentation
prepared. Please refer to <a href="../../../../Firmware/doc/README.html">Configuring ACCES I/O USB Devices To Work Under Linux</a>
for details.</p>
<p>To execute the program, attach a USB-AI16-16A analog input board to the USB bus and verify that its LED turns on, indicating
that firmware has been successfully uploaded to the board. Then simply type <span class="computer bold italic">./sample</span>
at the command line. There are no command line arguments to worry about. The program will search for the first USB-AI16-16A
analog input board on the USB bus. If it fails to find such a board, it will print an error message and quit. If it finds such
a board, the following output will appear:</p>

<a name="AIOUSBJavaSample"></a>
<h2>AIOUSB Java Sample</h2>
<p><a href="Sample.java.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">Sample.java</span></a> is a Java
implementation of the above sample program. It demonstrates use of the Java class library, which
is nearly identical to the C++ class library. Refer to
<a href="../../../java/doc/index.html">AIOUSB Java Class Library Reference</a> for detailed documentation
on the Java class library.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>The prerequisites for building <span class="filename">Sample.class</span> are that the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="_blank">Java Development Kit (JDK)</a> must be installed. In addition,
the AIOUSB Java library (<span class="filename">aiousb.jar</span>) must be installed somewhere on your system.
To compile the program, either use the supplied <span class="filename">Makefile</span> or use the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">javac -cp ../../java/aiousb.jar Sample.java</p>
<p>This sample program will write the bulk A/D data it receives from the device to a file named
<span class="filename">bulkdata</span> in the current directory. With the default settings, this file will be
2,000,000 bytes in size. If you prefer not to have the program create such a file, simply edit
<span class="filename">Sample.java</span> and set the variable named
<span class="varname">SAVE_DATA_TO_FILE</span> to <span class="italic">false</span>.</p>
<p>In addition, the probram checks the data received for zero, which, using the default settings would indicate
some sort of problem with the hardware or software. However, if zero is a legitimate count value for the device
to measure (i.e. you are feeding a voltage into the board that is at or below the board's minimum measurement
range), then you may wish to turn off that data check as well. You can do so by setting the variable named
<span class="varname">CHECK_FOR_ZERO_DATA</span> to <span class="italic">false</span>.</p>
<h3>Executing</h3>
<p>To execute the program, attach a USB-AI16-16A analog input board to the USB bus and verify that its LED
turns on, indicating that firmware has been successfully uploaded to the board. Then type the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">java -cp ../../java/aiousb.jar:. Sample</p>
<p>Notice that multiple class paths are specified in the above command: the path to
<span class="filename">aiousb.jar</span> and ".", which represents the class path of
<span class="filename">Sample.class</span> (assuming that it is the current directory).</p>
<p>Alternatively, assuming you used the make file to build the program, you can run it with the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">java -jar Sample.jar</p>
<p>There are no command line arguments to worry about. The program will search for the first USB-AI16-16A
analog input board on the USB bus. If it fails to find such a board, it will print an error message and quit.
If it finds such a board, the following output will appear:</p>

<h2>External Calibration Tool - C++ Version</h2>
<p><a href="extcal.cpp.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">Extcal.cpp</span></a> is another simple
program to demonstrate using the AIOUSB module and AIOUSB C++ class library to perform an external calibration
of an ACCES I/O model USB-AI16-16A analog input board. The program is not intended to be a comprehensive
demonstration and is limited to demonstrating the following features of the AIOUSB API:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Initializing and shutting down the API – <span class="funcname">USBDeviceManager::open()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">USBDeviceManager::close()</span></p>
	<li><p>Finding devices on the USB bus – <span class="funcname">USBDeviceManager::getDeviceByProductID()</span></p>
	<li><p>Configuring the board – <span class="funcname">USBDevice::setCommTimeout()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">AnalogInputSubsystem::setCalMode()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">AnalogInputSubsystem::setDiscardFirstSample()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">AnalogInputSubsystem::setTriggerMode()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">AnalogInputSubsystem::setGainCodeAndDiffMode()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">AnalogInputSubsystem::setOversample()</span></p>
	<li><p>Installing a default calibration table – <span class="funcname">AnalogInputSubsystem::calibrate(bool,...)</span></p>
	<li><p>Reading the analog inputs in counts – <span class="funcname">AnalogInputSubsystem::read()</span>
	<li><p>Generating an external calibration table – <span class="funcname">AnalogInputSubsystem::calibrate(double[],...)</span></p>
</ul>
<p>As with the sample program described above, the source code lines prefixed with the comment
<span class="computer bold">/*API*/</span> denote calls to the AIOUSB and C++ class library API.</p>
<p>The C++ class library should be considered <span class="italic">beta</span> software and is still being developed.
Notice, too, that when using the C++ class library it is not necessary (in fact, it's not permitted) to call
<span class="funcname">AIOUSB_Init()</span> or <span class="funcname">AIOUSB_Exit()</span>. These are implicitly called by
<span class="typename">USBDeviceManager::open()</span> and <span class="typename">USBDeviceManager::close()</span>. Refer to
<a href="../../../classlib/doc/index.html">AIOUSB C++ Class Library Reference</a> for detailed documentation on the C++
class library.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>The prerequisites for building <span class="filename">extcal</span> are the same as those for building
the sample program described above, with the added requirement that the C++ class library also be installed.
The program can be built using the make file provided or the explicit command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">g++ extcal.cpp -lclassaiousb -laiousbcpp -lusb-1.0 -o extcal</p>
<h3>Executing</h3>
<p>To execute the program, attach a USB-AI16-16A analog input board to the USB bus and verify that its LED turns on, indicating
that firmware has been successfully uploaded to the board. Then simply type <span class="computer bold italic">./extcal</span>
at the command line. There are no command line arguments to worry about. The program will search for the first USB-AI16-16A
analog input board on the USB bus. If it fails to find such a board, it will print an error message and quit. If it finds such
a board, the following output will appear:</p>

  This program demonstrates external calibration of a USB-AI16-16 device
  on the USB bus. For simplicity, it uses the first such device found on
  the bus and supports these product IDs: USB-AI16-16A, USB-AI16-16E,
  USB-AI12-16A, USB-AI12-16, USB-AI12-16E, USB-AI16-64MA, USB-AI16-64ME,
  USB-AI12-64MA, USB-AI12-64M, USB-AI12-64ME, USB-AI16-32A, USB-AI16-32E,
  USB-AI12-32A, USB-AI12-32, USB-AI12-32E, USB-AI16-64A, USB-AI16-64E,
  USB-AI12-64A, USB-AI12-64, USB-AI12-64E, USB-AI16-96A, USB-AI16-96E,
  USB-AI12-96A, USB-AI12-96, USB-AI12-96E, USB-AI16-128A, USB-AI16-128E,
  USB-AI12-128A, USB-AI12-128, USB-AI12-128E.

  This external calibration procedure allows you to inject a sequence of
  precise voltages into the USB-AI16-16 that will be used to calibrate its
  A/D. This procedure calibrates the A/D using channel 0 on the 0-10V range.
  A minimum of 2 calibration points are required. The procedure is as follows:

  1) Adjust a precision voltage source to a desired target voltage. These
     target voltages do not have to be evenly spaced or provided in any
     particular order.

  2) When you have adjusted the precision voltage source to your desired
     target, type in the exact voltage being fed into the USB-AI16-16 and
     press &lt;Enter&gt;. This program will read the A/D and display the reading,
     asking you to accept it or not. If it looks acceptable, press 'y'.
     Otherwise, press any other key and the program will retake the reading.

  3) When you are finished calibrating, press &lt;Enter&gt; without entering a
     voltage, and the A/D will be calibrated using the data entered, and
     the calibration table will be saved to a file in a format that can be
     subsequently loaded into the A/D.

<h2>External Calibration Tool - Java Version</h2>
<p><a href="Extcal.java.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">Extcal.java</span></a> is a Java
implementation of the above calibration utility. It demonstrates use of the Java class library, which
is nearly identical to the C++ class library. Refer to
<a href="../../../java/doc/index.html">AIOUSB Java Class Library Reference</a> for detailed documentation
on the Java class library.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>The prerequisites for building <span class="filename">Extcal.class</span> are that the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="_blank">Java Development Kit (JDK)</a> must be installed. In addition,
the AIOUSB Java library (<span class="filename">aiousb.jar</span>) must be installed somewhere on your system.
To compile the program, either use the supplied <span class="filename">Makefile</span> or use the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">javac -cp ../../java/aiousb.jar Extcal.java</p>
<h3>Executing</h3>
<p>To execute the program, attach a USB-AI16-16A analog input board to the USB bus and verify that its LED
turns on, indicating that firmware has been successfully uploaded to the board. Then type the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">java -cp ../../java/aiousb.jar:. Extcal</p>
<p>Notice that multiple class paths are specified in the above command: the path to
<span class="filename">aiousb.jar</span> and ".", which represents the class path of
<span class="filename">Extcal.class</span> (assuming that it is the current directory).</p>
<p>Alternatively, assuming you used the make file to build the program, you can run it with the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">java -jar Extcal.jar</p>
<p>There are no command line arguments to worry about. The program will search for the first USB-AI16-16A
analog input board on the USB bus. If it fails to find such a board, it will print an error message and quit.
If it finds such a board, the following output will appear:</p>
