These are samples for
[USB-AI](http://accesio.com/?p=../usb/usb-aio16-16a.html) series cards
that are used to take high speed analog voltage readings . The
operation of the cards can be thought of as two basic modes. One ,
which is demonstrated by the sample read_channels_test, is just a slow
looping function call to ADC_GetScan() and it returns a vector 
of voltage readings. It is designed to be as simple as possible to
reason and to implement in code. Think of it as the low performance
multi-meter that can take voltage readings for you on 16 or more
channels.

The second type of sample demonstrates the high speed analog sample
capabilities of the
[USB-AI](http://accesio.com/?p=../usb/usb-aio16-16a.html)
series. These samples take some more programming sophistication but
they generate higher data rates streams of sampled data. If you are not
interested in trying out the high speed acquisiton without immediately
writing code, please try out one of the JSON configuration file
inspired samples. These samples allow you to easily acqurire data at the
fastest speeds you choose without having to write code. All you have
to do is modify one of the JSON configuration files and pass it to one
of the samples and you are done.

@subpage sample_usb_ai16_16_burst_test Example of a quick continuous mode sample that sets up an AIOContinuousBuf buffer and then
proceeds to read data from it.

@subpage bulk_acquire_test Sample the demonstrates the older and unfortunately , less reliable Bulk Acquire API. This API has been effectively replaced by the continuous mode samples.
