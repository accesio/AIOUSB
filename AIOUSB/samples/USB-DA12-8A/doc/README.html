<h1>USB-DA12-8A Sample Program Release Notes</h1>
<p><a href="../../../../../doc/README.html">Table of Contents</a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This directory contains several sample programs for the USB-DA12-8A which demonstrate use of different
features and libraries.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><a href="#AIOUSB_C_SampleC">AIOUSB C Sample - sample.cpp</a></p>
	<li><p><a href="#AIOUSB_Cpp_SampleC">AIOUSB C++ Sample - SampleClass.cpp</a></p>
	<li><p><a href="#AIOUSB_Java_Sample">AIOUSB Java Sample - Sample.java</a></p>

<h2>AIOUSB C Sample</h2>
<p><a href="sample.cpp.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">Sample.cpp</span></a> is a simple
program to demonstrate using the AIOUSB module to control an ACCES I/O model USB-DA12-8A analog output
board. The program is not intended to be a comprehensive demonstration and is limited to demonstrating
the following features of the AIOUSB API:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Initializing and shutting down the API – <span class="funcname">AIOUSB_Init()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">AIOUSB_Exit()</span></p>
	<li><p>Identifying devices on the USB bus – <span class="funcname">QueryDeviceInfo()</span></p>
	<li><p>Obtaining the serial number of a device on the bus – <span class="funcname">GetDeviceSerialNumber()</span></p>
	<li><p>Writing to a single D/A channel – <span class="funcname">DACDirect()</span></p>
	<li><p>Writing to multiple D/A channels – <span class="funcname">DACMultiDirect()</span></p>
</ul>
<p>For easy identification, the source code lines prefixed with the comment <span class="computer bold">/*API*/</span>
denote calls to the AIOUSB API.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>Before building the program, make sure the <a href="http://www.libusb.org/" target="_blank">libusb</a>
module is installed. Also refer to the comments at the top of <span class="filename">sample.cpp</span> for additional details.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that the ACCES I/O AIOUSB module is installed (<span class="italic">see
<a href="../../../doc/README.html">Installing And Using AIOUSB Library</a></span>).</p>
<p>The simplest way to build the sample program is to type <span class="computer bold italic">make</span> at the command line.
The sample program is the default target in <span class="filename">Makefile</span>. Optionally, one can manually compile the
program with the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">g++ sample.cpp -laiousbcpp -lusb-1.0 -o sample</p>
<h3>Executing</h3>
<p>Before executing the sample program, make sure the Linux system is configured to automatically
detect ACCES I/O devices plugged into the USB bus and upload the appropriate firmware to those devices.
The files that support this automatic configuration have recently been updated and new documentation
prepared. Please refer to <a href="../../../../Firmware/doc/README.html">Configuring ACCES I/O USB Devices To Work Under Linux</a>
for details.</p>
<p>To execute the program, attach a USB-DA12-8A analog output board to the USB bus and verify that its LED turns on, indicating
that firmware has been successfully uploaded to the board. Then simply type <span class="computer bold italic">./sample</span>
at the command line. There are no command line arguments to worry about. The program will search for the first USB-DA12-8A
analog output board on the USB bus. If it fails to find such a board, it will print an error message and quit. If it finds such
a board, the following output will appear:</p>
<pre class="computer output">USB-DA12-8A sample program version 1.1, 29 January 2010
  AIOUSB library version 1.88, 18 January 2010
  This program demonstrates controlling a USB-DA12-8A device on
  the USB bus. For simplicity, it uses the first such device found
  on the bus.
ACCES devices found:
  Device at index 0:
    Product ID: 0x4002
    Product name: USB-DA12-8A
    Number of digital I/O bytes: 0
    Number of counters: 0
Serial number of device at index 0: 40e3a0d0a78887c2
Device properties successfully retrieved
2047 D/A counts successfully output to channel 0
D/A counts successfully output to 8 channels simultaneously</pre>
<p>The sample program prints out a list of all the ACCES devices found on the USB bus and then proceeds
to exercise the first USB-DA12-8A board found.</p>

<h2>AIOUSB C++ Sample</h2>
<p><a href="SampleClass.cpp.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">SampleClass.cpp</span></a> is a C++
implementation of the above sample program. It demonstrates use of the C++ class library, which
utilizes the AIOUSB C-language library. Refer to
<a href="../../../classlib/doc/index.html">AIOUSB C++ Class Library Reference</a> for detailed documentation
on the C++ class library.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>The prerequisites for building <span class="filename">SampleClass</span> are the same as for
<span class="filename">sample</span> described above. In addition, the C++ class libraries must be
installed and be accessible in the include path and linker library path. Once these requirements
are satisfied, you can build the sample program with the supplied <span class="filename">Makefile</span>.</p>
<h3>Executing</h3>
<p>Assuming you have an USB-DA12-8A device up and running (as indicated by its illuminated LED), type the
following command to execute the sample program:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">./SampleClass</p>
<p>There are no command line arguments to worry about. The program will search for the first USB-DA12-8A device
on the USB bus. If it fails to find such a board, it will print an error message and quit. If it finds such a
device, the following output will appear:</p>
<pre class="computer output">USB-DA12-8A sample program version 1.1, 29 January 2010
  AIOUSB C++ class library version 1.8, 18 January 2010
  AIOUSB library version 1.88, 18 January 2010

  This program demonstrates controlling a USB-DA12-8A family device on
  the USB bus. For simplicity, it uses the first such device found
  on the bus and supports these product IDs: USB-DA12-8A-A, USB-DA12-8A

<h2>AIOUSB Java Sample</h2>
<p><a href="Sample.java.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">Sample.java</span></a> is a Java
implementation of the above sample program. It demonstrates use of the Java class library, which
utilizes the AIOUSB C-language library. Refer to
<a href="../../../java/doc/index.html">AIOUSB Java Class Library Reference</a> for detailed documentation
on the Java class library.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>The prerequisites for building <span class="filename">Sample.jar</span> are that the
