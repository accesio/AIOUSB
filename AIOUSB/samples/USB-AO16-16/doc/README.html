<h1>USB-AO16-16A Sample Program Release Notes</h1>
<p><a href="../../../../../doc/README.html">Table of Contents</a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><a href="sample.cpp.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">Sample.cpp</span></a> is a simple
program to demonstrate using the AIOUSB module to control an ACCES I/O model USB-AO16-16A analog output
board. The program is not intended to be a comprehensive demonstration and is limited to demonstrating
the following features of the AIOUSB API:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Initializing and shutting down the API – <span class="funcname">AIOUSB_Init()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">AIOUSB_Exit()</span></p>
	<li><p>Identifying devices on the USB bus – <span class="funcname">QueryDeviceInfo()</span></p>
	<li><p>Obtaining the serial number of a device on the bus – <span class="funcname">GetDeviceSerialNumber()</span></p>
	<li><p>Setting the output range – <span class="funcname">DACSetBoardRange()</span></p>
	<li><p>Writing to a single D/A channel – <span class="funcname">DACDirect()</span></p>
	<li><p>Writing to multiple D/A channels – <span class="funcname">DACMultiDirect()</span></p>
</ul>
<p>For easy identification, the source code lines prefixed with the comment <span class="computer bold">/*API*/</span>
denote calls to the AIOUSB API.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>Before building the program, make sure the <a href="http://www.libusb.org/" target="_blank">libusb</a>
module is installed. Also refer to the comments at the top of <span class="filename">sample.cpp</span> for additional details.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that the ACCES I/O AIOUSB module is installed (<span class="italic">see
<a href="../../../doc/README.html">Installing And Using AIOUSB Library</a></span>).</p>
<p>The simplest way to build the sample program is to type <span class="computer bold italic">make</span> at the command line.
The sample program is the default target in <span class="filename">Makefile</span>. Optionally, one can manually compile the
program with the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">g++ sample.cpp -laiousb -lusb-1.0 -o sample</p>
<h3>Executing</h3>
<p>Before executing the sample program, make sure the Linux system is configured to automatically
detect ACCES I/O devices plugged into the USB bus and upload the appropriate firmware to those devices.
The files that support this automatic configuration have recently been updated and new documentation
prepared. Please refer to <a href="../../../../Firmware/doc/README.html">Configuring ACCES I/O USB Devices To Work Under Linux</a>
for details.</p>
<p>To execute the program, attach a USB-AO16-16A analog output board to the USB bus and verify that its LED turns on, indicating
that firmware has been successfully uploaded to the board. Then simply type <span class="computer bold italic">./sample</span>
at the command line. There are no command line arguments to worry about. The program will search for the first USB-AO16-16A
analog output board on the USB bus. If it fails to find such a board, it will print an error message and quit. If it finds such
a board, the following output will appear:</p>
<pre class="computer output">USB-AO16-16A sample program version 1.13, 26 November 2009
  AIOUSB library version 1.84, 22 December 2009
  This program demonstrates controlling a USB-AO16-16A device on
  the USB bus. For simplicity, it uses the first such device found
  on the bus.
ACCES devices found:
  Device at index 0:
    Product ID: 0x8040
    Product name: USB-AI16-16A
    Number of digital I/O bytes: 2
    Number of counters: 1
  Device at index 1:
    Product ID: 0x8060
    Product name: USB-AO16-16A
    Number of digital I/O bytes: 2
    Number of counters: 0
Serial number of device at index 1: 40e39396fc4198c0
D/A output range successfully set
32767 D/A counts successfully output to channel 0
D/A counts successfully output to 16 channels simultaneously</pre>
<p>The sample program prints out a list of all the ACCES devices found on the USB bus and then proceeds
to exercise the first USB-AO16-16A board found. Notice in the above example, the sample program also found
a model USB-AI16-16A on the bus.</p>
