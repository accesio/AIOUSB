<h1>AIOUSB Java Class Library Reference</h1>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">AIOUSB Java Class Library</span> is an object-oriented
Java layer that runs on top of the AIOUSB library, utilizing the Java Native Interface (JNI) to
enable other Java libraries and applications to control ACCES I/O USB products. All access to
the USB devices is through fully object-oriented Java classes. The user never needs to call the
underlying AIOUSB library. (In fact, it's not even possible to do so in Java, although it is
possible in C++.)</p>
<p>This Java library currently supports all the features of all the USB products except the D/A
streaming features of the USB-DA12-8A product. While the underlying AIOUSB library has been
thoroughly tested, this Java library has not yet been thoroughly tested and should be considered
<span style="font-style: italic;">beta</span> software.</p>
<h2>Packaging</h2>
<p>For convenience, the entire AIOUSB Java class library is packaged into a JAR file. You may
extract the classes from the JAR file, add your own classes to it or refer to the JAR file as a
class path. For example, if you have a Java program named
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Test.java</span> which uses the AIOUSB Java
class library, you can compile it with the command:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm; font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">javac -cp /path/aiousb.jar Test.java</p>
<p>After you have compiled it, producing <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Test.class</span>,
you can run the program with the command:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1cm; font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">java -cp /path/aiousb.jar:. Test</p>
<p>Notice that multiple class paths are specified in the above command: the path to
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">aiousb.jar</span> and ".", which represents
the class path of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Test.class</span> (assuming
that it is the current directory).</p>
<h2>JNI Shared Library</h2>
<p>Between AIOUSB and this Java class library is a module named
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">libjavaaiousb.so</span> which contains the
JNI interface. This interface module is a shared library that is loaded by the Java VM at run-time.
Therefore, it must be located in a place where the operating system loader can find it. You can
also modify the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>
environment variable to point to where
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">libjavaaiousb.so</span> resides.</p>
<h2>Sample Program</h2>
<p>Below is an example of a minimalist Java program that demonstrates how to properly initialize the library,
query the bus for devices, query an individual device for its product ID and name and then terminate use of the
library. If <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">libjavaaiousb.so</span> is properly installed,
you should be able to copy this sample program from this document, paste it into a file named
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Test.java</span> and compile it using the command shown below.
This program uses the first ACCES device it finds on the bus. A "real" application would probably be looking for
devices of a particular type, which can be located using one of the
<i><a href="com/acces/aiousb/USBDeviceManager.html#getDeviceByProductID(int)">USBDeviceManager.getDeviceByProductID()</a></i> methods.</p>
<pre style="background: #eeffff; border: 1px solid #000000; margin-bottom: 0cm; padding: 0.1cm;">/*
 * compile: javac -cp /path/aiousb.jar Test.java
 * run: java -cp /path/aiousb.jar:. Test
 */
<span style="background: #ffff80;">import com.acces.aiousb.*;</span>
class Test {
  public static void main( String args[] ) {
    USBDeviceManager deviceManager = new <span style="background: #ffff80;">USBDeviceManager</span>();
    try {
      deviceManager.<span style="background: #ffff80;">open</span>();
      USBDevice[] devices = deviceManager.<span style="background: #ffff80;">getDeviceByProductID</span>( USBDeviceManager.MIN_PRODUCT_ID
        , USBDeviceManager.MAX_PRODUCT_ID );
      if( devices.length > 0 )
        System.out.println( "Found a device with product ID " + Integer.toHexString( devices[ 0 ].<span style="background: #ffff80;">getProductID</span>() )
          + " and name \'" + devices[ 0 ].<span style="background: #ffff80;">getName</span>() + "\'" );
      else
        System.out.println( "No devices found" );
      deviceManager.<span style="background: #ffff80;">close</span>();
    } catch( Exception ex ) {
      System.err.println( "Error \'" + ex.toString() + "\' occurred while manipulating device" );
      if( deviceManager.<span style="background: #ffff80;">isOpen</span>() )
        deviceManager.<span style="background: #ffff80;">close</span>();
    }  // catch( ...
  }  // main()
}  // class Test</pre>
<p>The above example is obviously simplistic as well as generic. In a "real" application, one would
search for devices of a specific type (i.e. product ID) and then <i>cast</i> instances of the generic
class <i>USBDevice</i> to a specific device class, such as
<i><a href="com/acces/aiousb/USB_AI16_Family.html">USB_AI16_Family</a></i>.
