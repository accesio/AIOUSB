<h2>Introduction</h2>
AIOUSB is a general purpose C based library developed for communicating with 
ACCES I/O products' line of USB data acquistion modules. In addition to providing 
C and C++ support, this packages also provides wrapper language support for such languages
as Ruby, Perl, Python, PHP, Java, R.

AIOUSB is developed under Mac OS X and Linux, but is set-up to be highly 
portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. 
Furthermore, executables for Windows are available.
