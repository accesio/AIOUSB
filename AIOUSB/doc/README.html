<h2 style="text-indent: 5px; color: #ffffff; background: #3677ac;">AIOUSB C Library</h2>
<p>The AIOUSB C language library implements the core functionality of the entire suite of libraries, supporting
the capabilities of all of ACCES' USB products. (The only deficiency is that the D/A streaming functions in
the USB-DA12-8A product are not currently implemented, although they will be eventually.) This library is
written in C and compiled for both C (gcc) and C++ (g++) and may be used as-is with C and C++ programs. This
library utilizes <a href="http://libusb.info" target="_blank">libusb</a> (preferred version 1.0.6) for all USB
communications.</p>
<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>Assuming youâ€™re starting from the root directory of the distribution, installing AIOUSB consists of performing
these few simple steps (logged in as 'root', of course).</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">mkdir /usr/local/include/aiousb<br>
cp -p lib/aiousb.h /usr/local/include/aiousb<br>
cp -p lib/libaiousb*.a /usr/local/lib<br>
export CPATH=/usr/local/include/libusb-1.0/:/usr/local/include/aiousb</p>
<p>You can, of course, place the AIOUSB files (<span class="filename">aiousb.h</span>,
<span class="filename">libaiousb*.a</span>) elsewhere, such as in the local directory of the application
program that will use AIOUSB. The above steps are suggested in order to conform to the usual Linux conventions
and make the AIOUSB files available to all users and all application programs.</p>
<p>If you do locate the libraries and header files somewhere else, there is an environment variable you can
set which is used by the sample program make files:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">export AIOUSBLIBDIR="path to the AIOUSB libraries"</p>
<p>There are several variations of the AIOUSB C library. They all begin with "libaiousb" and have an extension of ".a".
There are currently no shared versions of the AIOUSB C library. The library files which contain the string "cpp"
contain object modules that are compiled for use with C++ (using "g++"). They are <span class="italic">not</span> C++
class libraries (see below for information about the genuine C++ class library). The library files which contain the
string "dbg" are compiled for source level debugging with the "-ggdb" compiler option. At present, there are four
variations of the AIOUSB C library: C or C++, and release or debug.</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Complete documentation for the AIOUSB C library may be found in <a href="../lib/doc/Reference.html">AIOUSB API Reference</a>.
This document is based on the <a href="http://accesio.com/MANUALS/USB%20Software%20Reference.pdf">USB Software Reference Manual</a>,
but adds considerably more detail and includes documentation for the many new functions added to the Linux
implementation. This documentation is also intended to be useful as a reference for the Windows implementation of
AIOUSB, with differences between the Linux and Windows implementations clearly highlighted.</p>
<h3>Compiling Programs</h3>
<p>Assuming you have installed the AIOUSB C library according to the above instructions, compiling a program to use
it is as simple as:</p>
<p><span class="computer bold indent1">g++ -pthread -fPIC sample.cpp -laiousbcpp -lusb-1.0 -o sample</span> (C++)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="computer bold indent1">gcc -std=gnu99 -D_GNU_SOURCE -pthread -fPIC sample.c -laiousb -lusb-1.0 -lm -o sample</span> (C)</p>
<h2 style="text-indent: 5px; color: #ffffff; background: #3677ac;">C++ and Java Class Libraries</h2>
<p>Residing one level above the AIOUSB C library are two additional object-oriented sister libraries: a C++ class library
and a nearly identical Java class library. Although these class libraries should be considered <span class="italic">beta</span>
software and are still in development, testing so far shows that they are working reliably enough to use. There are a few
sample programs in the "samples" directory demonstrating use of both of these class libraries and more such samples will be
provided in the future.</p>
<p>The C++ and Java class libraries are designed to be as similar as possible, with the exception of inescapable language
and library differences. Otherwise, the structure, functionality, class names, method names and parameter names are identical
between the two. As a result, the documentation for either library can largely serve as the documentation for both.</p>
<h2 style="text-indent: 5px; color: #ffffff; background: #3677ac;">C++ Class Library</h2>
<p>The C++ class library implements the entire functionality of the AIOUSB C library and adds substantial ease-of-use
features, in a robust object-oriented <a href="../classlib/doc/inherits.html">class hierarchy</a>.
<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>You may install the C++ class library in the same manner as described for the AIOUSB C library above, using the commands:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">cp -p classlib/*.hpp /usr/local/include/aiousb<br>
cp -p classlib/libclassaiousb*.a /usr/local/lib</p>
<p>If you don't wish to copy all those files, then you can use the environment variables (<span class="varname">CPATH</span>
and <span class="varname">AIOUSBCLASSLIBDIR</span>) instead. As for the AIOUSB C library, there is an environment variable
that specifies the location of the C++ class libraries for use in the sample program make files:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">export AIOUSBCLASSLIBDIR="path to the AIOUSB C++ class libraries"</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Complete documentation for the C++ class library may be found in <a href="../classlib/doc/index.html">AIOUSB C++ Class Library Reference</a>.
<h3>Compiling Programs</h3>
<p>Assuming you have installed the C++ class library according to the above instructions, compiling a program to use
it is as simple as:</p>
<p><span class="computer bold indent1">g++ -pthread -fPIC sample.cpp -lclassaiousb -laiousbcpp -lusb-1.0 -o sample</span></p>
<h2 style="text-indent: 5px; color: #ffffff; background: #3677ac;">Java Class Library</h2>
<p>The Java class library implements the entire functionality of the AIOUSB C library and adds substantial ease-of-use
features, in a robust object-oriented <a href="../java/doc/com/acces/aiousb/package-tree.html">class hierarchy</a>.
<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>There really isn't anything to install with the Java class library. The entire library resides within
<span class="filename">aiousb.jar</span>. You can use this JAR file as a class path when compiling or executing Java application
programs, or you can use the directory that contains the actual "*.class" files as the class path, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>As with the C and C++ libraries, the location of the Java library can be specified in an environment variable which is used
by the sample program make files:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">export AIOUSBJAVALIBDIR="path to the AIOUSB java libraries"</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Complete documentation for the Java class library may be found in <a href="../java/doc/index.html">AIOUSB Java Class Library Reference</a>.
<h3>Compiling Programs</h3>
<p>To compile Java programs to use the AIOUSB Java class library, use the command:</p>
<p><span class="computer bold indent1">javac -cp /path/aiousb.jar Sample.java</span> (where "path" is where you installed
the Java class library)</p>
<p>To execute the compiled Java program, use the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">java -cp /path/aiousb.jar:. Sample</p>
