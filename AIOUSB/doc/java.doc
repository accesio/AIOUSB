The Java class library implements the entire functionality of the AIOUSB C library and adds substantial ease-of-use features, in a robust object-oriented class hierarchy.
Installing

There really isn't anything to install with the Java class library. The entire library resides within aiousb.jar. You can use this JAR file as a class path when compiling or executing Java application programs, or you can use the directory that contains the actual "*.class" files as the class path, the choice is yours.

As with the C and C++ libraries, the location of the Java library can be specified in an environment variable which is used by the sample program make files:

export AIOUSBJAVALIBDIR="path to the AIOUSB java libraries"
Documentation

Complete documentation for the Java class library may be found in AIOUSB Java Class Library Reference.
Compiling Programs

To compile Java programs to use the AIOUSB Java class library, use the command:

javac -cp /path/aiousb.jar Sample.java (where "path" is where you installed the Java class library)

To execute the compiled Java program, use the command:

java -cp /path/aiousb.jar:. Sample
